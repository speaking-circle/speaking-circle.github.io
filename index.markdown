Many companies are already actively involved in tech PR / Devrel.

There are several clear benefits to investing in tech PR:

- Well-known companies tend to have an easier time hiring new employees because people are more likely to consider job opportunities with them;
- Employees are more likely to stay with a company that has a strong reputation, leading to lower turnover rates;
- When employees can see the direct impact of their work on the company, they are more motivated and loyal to the organization.

Running a successful tech PR program requires producing engaging content and consistently training effective spokespeople and authors. One good way to do this is by establishing a "speakers circle" within the company.

## Speaking Circle

A "Speaking Circle" is a regular workshop for employees who want to improve their public speaking skills and gain a deeper understanding of their work. This group-based learning opportunity allows individuals to develop their skills and knowledge in a supportive environment.

While the frequency of "Speaking Circle" workshops can vary and depend on the company's and employees' specific needs and goals, holding sessions at least once a month usually leads to good results. 

Attending a "Speaking Circle" workshop requires a full-day commitment, meaning employees must take a day off from their usual work duties to participate.

After participating in a "Speaking Circle" workshop, employees need time to relax, process the new experience, and go home and rest.

The "Speaking Circle" workshops are only offered in a physical, offline setting: full personal involvement from attendees is a must.

During "Speakers' Circle" meetings, there are two main activities: reflection and training.

## Reflection activity

The training activity of "Speaking Circle" workshop focuses on helping employees develop performance skills, including acting and public speaking techniques.

During this activity, we prepare presentations based on the insights and reflections from the reflection activity of the workshop.

As a group, we evaluate each artifact to decide whether it is better suited for publication or presentation.

In preparation for presentations, we work with the acting coach to learn the fundamentals of stagecraft and acting, practice public speaking techniques, and develop storytelling skills. We also focus on engaging the audience and helping employees feel comfortable and confident on stage. This activity helps them overcome fear and worry and accept themselves in a public setting.

As a result of consistently holding "Speaking Circle" workshops throughout the year, employees receive ongoing training and development. A steady stream of materials for publication or presentation is produced.
